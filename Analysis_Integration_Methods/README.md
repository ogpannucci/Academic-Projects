# Analysis of Various Numerical Integration Methods

This project is an analytical comparison of different numerical integration methods. The focus is on evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of methods such as the trapezoidal rule. This project was created as a joint effort.

## Project Structure

- **Code**: The main code for the project is contained in the `Trapezoid.py` file.
- **Report**: The detailed analysis and findings of the project are documented in a report created as a joint project.

## Running the Code

To run the code and obtain the results:

1. **Modify k Value**: In the `Trapezoid.py` file, locate the "globals" section. Comment out the undesired k value. The k values for this problem can be either π or π².
   ```python
   # k = pi
   k = pi**2
